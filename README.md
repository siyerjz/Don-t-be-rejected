# You will never be rejected 💕

A fun and interactive website that asks someone on a movie date or whatever date you'll plan with playful UI interactions!

## Features ✨

- **Progressive Questions**: Each "No" click changes the question and makes it harder to refuse
- **Interactive Buttons**: The "No" button gets smaller while "Yes" gets bigger with each refusal
- **Escape Mechanism**: After 2 "No" clicks, the "No" button runs away from your cursor!
- **Cute Design**: Pink gradient background with emojis and smooth animations
- **Success Animation**: Floating hearts when "Yes" is finally clicked

## How it Works 🎯

1. **Initial Question**: "Hey, wanna go on a movie date with me? 🎬💕"
2. **1st No**: "Are you sure? 🥺💔" (buttons resize)
3. **2nd No**: "Final answer? 😢💭" (buttons resize more + No button starts running away)
4. **3rd No**: "Still a no? Just checking... 😭🙏" (No button actively escapes cursor)
5. **Yes**: "Yaaay! See you then! 🎉💖✨" with heart animations
